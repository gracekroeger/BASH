<h1>Dear Bash,</h1>

		I love how complicated you can be to do something really simple, like making a new folder. I adore how you look super cool always. I will always remember when I first saw you, and I uttered the words, "hello world". We created a website togther and I will never forget that. You listen to my commands, and I know that can't be easy since I don't always say the right thing. You help me make amazing things. I love watching the things you create with just a little bit of guidance. Last week, I was amzed with how you created a whole folder when I told you, "mkdir -p". You are so loyal with how you support my every wish. The way you allow me to move between folders when I say "cd", it just such a beautiful process that youve introduced me to, Bash. I hope to continue spending more and more time with you.

		Love,

		Grace
