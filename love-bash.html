Dear Bash,
	<br>
	I love how complicated you can be to do something really simple, like making a new folder. I adore how you look super cool always. You listen to my commands, and I know that can't be easy since I don't always say the right thing. You help me make amazing things. I love watching the things you create with just a little bit of guidance. Last week, I was amzed with how you created a whole folder when I told you, "mkdir -p". I hope to continue spending more and more time with you. 
	<br>
	Love,
	Grace
